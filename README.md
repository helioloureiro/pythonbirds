Python Birds - english
======================

This is an english version from [pythonbirds] (https://github.com/pythonprobr/pythonbirds/)

# Why???

Idea is to make is easier for non portuguese readers to use the same code.  My intent is to
have it available for coding dojos.

# Requirements
 * Python3 (I'm running on top of Python 3.2.3)
 * python3-tk

I'm running it on Ubuntu 12.04 w/ python3 and python3-tk provided by distro.  No external
loads (hopefully).

# TODO
 * Convert file names to english
 * Convert function names to english
 * Convert images, sounds, etc to english
